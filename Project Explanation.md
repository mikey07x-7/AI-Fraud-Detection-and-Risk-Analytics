# AI Fraud Detection and Risk Analytics - Project Explanation

## What the project does

AI Fraud Detection and Risk Analytics ingests transactional data and predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent. It creates risk features such as:

* Transaction frequency per user
* Time-since-last transaction
* Deviation from user average amount
* Device/IP mismatch flags

The project trains machine-learning models to detect fraud, evaluates model performance using business-relevant metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, PR-AUC, ROC-AUC), and provides explainability via feature importances and SHAP values, enabling analysts to trust and act on predictions.

## Why it matters for industry

Fraud causes significant financial losses, both direct and indirect (e.g., reputational damage, compliance penalties). Automating detection:

* Reduces financial losses
* Speeds up investigations
* Reduces manual review workload
* Helps prioritize alerts by risk
* Reduces false positives, minimizing customer inconvenience and operational costs

## Real-world use cases

* Credit card / debit card transaction fraud detection
* Online payments and marketplace transaction risk scoring
* Account takeover detection (unusual device/IP activity)
* Insurance claim fraud detection (with adapted features)
* AML (anti-money laundering) pre-screening for suspicious patterns
